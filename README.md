uptime-monitor
==============

Lightweight website monitoring and alerting without any external dependencies except of nodejs and two libraries.
I looked for an easy to deploy application to monitor several URLs.

If a downtime is discovered, a notification email is sent. An email is sent again if the URL has recovered.

Installation
============

```
npm install
```

Run with `./index.js`.
